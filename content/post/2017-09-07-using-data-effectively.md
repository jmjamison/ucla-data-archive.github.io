Looking for contextually-based data and computational training in a supportive, collaborative environment? Come join us in the Young Research Library Presentation Room for an introduction to the Software & Data Carpentry movement -- a community-based computational and data skills instruction. The Community Development Lead for Software & Data Carpentry, Belinda Weaver, is in town from Brisbane, Australia to promote and catalyze the Carpentries at UCLA. We also have Juliane Schneider, Lead Data Curator of Harvard's Catalyst archive and maintainer of the Library Carpentry Open Refine lesson, to tell us about the newest Carpentry -- Library Carpentry -- and how it fits into the broader Carpentry movements. John Chodacki from CDL's UC3 is on hand to tell us about the next steps for Library Carpentry in the North Americas.
